# Concrete Image Classification
Deep Learning project on how to classify concretes with or without cracks.
 
## Project Description
There are several types of common concrete cracks namely hairline cracks which usually develop in concrete foundation as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks which
occur while the concrete is curing, settlement cracks which happen when part of concrete sinks or when the ground underneath the slab isnâ€™t compacted properly as well as structural cracks which form due to incorrect design. 

Concrete cracks may endanger the safety and durability of a building if not being identified quickly and left untreated. Hence, this project is to perform image classification to classify concretes with or without cracks. The developed model is impactful and may save thousands of lives.

## Results

## Discussion
From the TensorBoard Loss Graph above, we can conclude that the validation is overfit at the end of the model training, there are several ways on how to solve the model overfitting issues such as:
<ul>
  <li>Adding More Dropout Layers</li>
  <li>Regularization and Ensembling</li>
  <li>Saving best model by using model_checkpoint</li>
</ul>
